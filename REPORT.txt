CHALLENGES AND LEARNING

I have faced so many challenges like how do they work together and how to make a sql script then how to connect the backend to front end or how to connect the html,css and jscript and thanks to youtube for the tutorial and that way i have now understand how they connect but still i think there are more technique or what to connect the html with databases and the storing the data cause sometimes its not working and sometimes its glitching but i hope i gain more knowledge about web developing and databases.
